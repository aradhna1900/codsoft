        <p>Sarojini Naidu (13 February 1879 2 March 1949)[1] was an Indian political activist and poet who served as the first Governor of 
            United Provinces, after India's independence. She played an important role in the Indian independence movement against the British Raj. 
            She was the first Indian woman to be president of the Indian National Congress and appointed governor of a state.
            Born in a Bengali family in Hyderabad, Naidu was educated in Madras, London and Cambridge. Following her time in Britain, where she worked as a suffragist, 
            she was drawn to the Congress party's struggle for India's inependence. She became a part of the national movement and became a follower of Mahatma Gandhi
             and his idea of swaraj (self rule).
             She was appointed Congress president in 1925 and, when India achieved its independence, became Governor of the United Provinces in 1947.<b>
